			<h1>About TESS</h1>
			<p>
				TESS (short for Transisting Exoplanet Survey Satallite) is an Explorer class planet finder.  
				When launched, TESS will identify planets ranging from Earth-sized planets to Gas Giants and orbit
				a wide range of stellay types and orgital distances.  The main mission of TESS is to detect small host stars
				along with their respective host planets.
				<br>
				TESS will observe and monitor the brightness of over 200,000 stars in the course of its two year
				mission as well as search for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transists, which
				happen when a planet's orbit causes it to be infront of its host star relative to earth.  
				<br>
				TESS is mainly lead by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), home to the host of the project,
				Dr. George Ricker.
