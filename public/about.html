			<h1>About TESS</h1>
			<p>
				TESS (short for Transisting Exoplanet Survey Satallite) is an Explorer class planet finder.  When launched, TESS will identify planets ranging from Earth-sized planets to Gas Giants and orbit a wide range of stellar types and orbital distances.  The main mission of TESS is to detect small host stars along with their respective host planets.
				<br><br>
				TESS will observe and monitor the brightness of over 200,000 stars in the course of its two year mission as well as search for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transists, which happen when a planet's orbit causes it to be infront of its host star relative to earth.  
				<br><br>
				TESS is mainly lead by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), home to the host of the project, Dr. George Ricker.

			<h1>About the Adopt-A-Star Program</h1>
			<p>
				The Adopt-A-Star program was started by Travis Metcalfe in January 2008 at
				the Space Science Institute in Boulder, CO to 
				help raise research funds for the Kepler Astroseismec Science Consortium.
				The project started with the Kepler Space Telescope which
				monitored the brightness of over 150,00 stars.
				<br><br>
				The Space Science Institute is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization run my professional astronomers.  When you adopt a star through this website, you are
				supporting the work of many man-hours of research and for the tools to do research.  So adopt a star and support the work of the Space Science Institute!
